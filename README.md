Backbone library for the WordPress REST API or "WP-API"
==============

## Summary

This library provides an interface for the [WP REST API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) by providing Backbone Models and Collections for all endpoints in the API.


## Using

Activate the WP-API plugin. Enqueue the script directly:

```php
wp_enqueue_script( 'wp-api' );
```

or as a dependency for your script:

```php
wp_enqueue_script( 'my_script', 'path/to/my/script', array( 'wp-api' ) );
```

The library parses the root endpoint (the 'Schema') and creates matching Backbone models and collections. You will now have two root objects available to you: `wp.api.models` and `wp.api.collections`.

The models and collections include:

```
Models:
 * Category
 * Comment
 * Media
 * Page
 * PageMeta
 * PageRevision
 * Post
 * PostMeta
 * PostRevision
 * Schema
 * Status
 * Tag
 * Taxonomy
 * Type
 * User

Collections:
 * Categories
 * Comments
 * Media
 * PageMeta
 * PageRevisions
 * Pages
 * Posts
 * Statuses
 * Tags
 * Taxonomies
 * Types
 * Users
```

You can use these endpoints as-is to read, update, create and delete items using standard Backbone methods (fetch, sync, save & destroy for models, sync for collections). You can also extend these objects to make them your own, and build your views on top of them.

### Default values

Each model and collection includes a reference to its default values, for example:

```
wp.api.models.Post.prototype.args
 * author: null
 * comment_status: null
 * content: null
 * date: null
 * date_gmt: null
 * excerpt: null
 * featured_image: null
 * format: null
 * modified: null
 * modified_gmt: null
 * password: null
 * ping_status: null
 * slug: null
 * status: null
 * sticky: null
 * title: null
```

### Available methods

Each model and collection contains a list of methods the corresponding endpoint supports. For example, models created from `wp.api.models.Post` have a methods array of:

```
["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]
```

### Accepted options

Each model and collection contains a list of options the corrosponding endpoint accepts (note that options are passed as the second parameter when creating models or collections), for example:

```
wp.api.collections.Posts.prototype.options
 * author
 * context
 * filter
 * order
 * orderby
 * page
 * per_page
 * search
 * status
```

### Localizing the API Schema
The client will accept and use a localized schema as part of the `wpApiSettings` object. The Schema is currently not passed by default; instead the client makes an ajax request to the API to load the Schema, then caches it in the browser's session storage (if available). Activating the client-js plugin with `SCRIPT_DEBUG` enabled uses a localized Schema. Check the [client-js example](https://github.com/WP-API/client-js/blob/master/client-js.php) or this branch which [attempts to only localize the schema once per client](https://github.com/WP-API/client-js/compare/features/only-localize-schma-once?expand=1).

### Waiting for the client to load
Client startup is asynchronous. If the api schema is localized, the client can start immediately; if not the client makes an ajax request to load the schema. The client exposes a load promise for provide a reliable wait to wait for client to be ready:

```js
wp.api.loadPromise.done( function() {
	//... use the client here
} )
```

### Model examples:

To create a post and edit its categories, make sure you are logged in, then:

```js
// Create a new post
var post = new wp.api.models.Post( { title: 'This is a test post' } );
post.save();

// Load an existing post
var post = new wp.api.models.Post( { id: 1 } );
post.fetch();

// Get a collection of the post's categories (returns a promise)
// Uses _embedded data if available, in which case promise resolves immediately.
post.getCategories().done( function( postCategories ) {
	// ... do something with the categories.
	// The new post has an single Category: Uncategorized
	console.log( postCategories[0].name );
	// response -> "Uncategorized"
} );

// Get a posts author User model.
post.getAuthorUser().done( function( user ){
	// ... do something with user
	console.log( user.get( 'name' ) );
} );

// Get a posts featured image Media model.
post.getFeaturedImage().done( function( image ){
	// ... do something with image
	console.log( image );
} );

// Set the post categories.
post.setCategories( [ 'apples', 'oranges' ] );

// Get all the categories
var allCategories = new wp.api.collections.Categories()
allCategories.fetch();

var appleCategory = allCategories.findWhere( { slug: 'apples' } );

// Add the category to the postCategories collection we previously fetched.
appleCategory.set( 'parent_post', post.get( 'id' ) );

// Use the POST method so Backbone will not PUT it even though it has an id.
postCategories.create( appleCategory.toJSON(), { type: 'POST' } );

// Remove the Uncategorized category
postCategories.at( 0 ).destroy();

// Check the results - re-fetch
postCategories = post.getCategories();

postCategories.at( 0 ).get( 'name' );
// response -> "apples"
```

### Collection examples:

to get the last 10 posts:

```js
var postsCollection = new wp.api.collections.Posts();
postsCollection.fetch();
```

to get the last 25 posts:

```js
postsCollection.fetch( { data: { per_page: 25 } } );
```

use filter to change the order & orderby options:

```js
postsCollection.fetch( { data: { 'filter': { 'orderby': 'title', 'order': 'ASC' } } } );
```

All collections support pagination automatically, and you can get the next page of results using `more`:

```js
postsCollection.more();
```

to get page 5 of a collection:

```js
posts.fetch( { data: { page: 5 }  } );
```

check if the collection has any more posts:

```js
posts.hasMore();
```

### Working With Revisions
You can access post or page revisions using the PostRevisions or PageRevisions collections or through the Post or Page collection.

For example, to get a collection of all revisions of post ID 1:
```
var revisions = new wp.api.collections.PostRevisions({}, { parent: 1 });
```

Revision collections can also be accessed via their parent's collection. This example makes 2 HTTP requests instead of one, but now the original post and its revisions are avaible:

```
var post = new wp.api.models.Post( { id: 1 } );
post.fetch();
post.getRevisions().done( function( revisions ){
console.log( revisions );
});
```

If you add custom endpoints to the api they will also become available as models/collections. For example, you will get new models and collections when you [add REST API support to your custom post type](http://v2.wp-api.org/extending/custom-content-types/). Note: because the schema is stored in the user's session cache to avoid re-fetching, you may need to open a new tab to get a new read of the Schema.

## Development

To develop, build and test this library, you must have [Node](http://nodejs.org) installed. For Windows users, simply [download](http://nodejs.org/download/) and install Node. For Mac users, we recommend installing Node using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install node` to install Node.js.

### Installation

Clone this repository, and then execute the following commands within the checkout directory:
```bash
$ npm install
```
This will use Node's NPM package manager to install all the dependencies for building and testing this library. We use [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage client script dependencies, but Bower script installation is handled as part of the `npm install` command.

### Building

To update the compiled JavaScript files in the `build/` directory after you've made changes, run the library's `build` script with the npm command:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
This will use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to check the source scripts in `js/` for syntax errors, then concatenate and minify them to create [the minified wp-api.min.js file](build/js/wp-api.min.js) and a corresponding source map file.

### Testing

You can run the unit tests for this library using Grunt:
```bash
$ npm test
```

#### A note on Grunt

The custom "build" and "test" scripts defined in this library's [package.json](package.json) enable access to Grunt's functionality after a simple `npm install`; however, these commands can also be run directly using Grunt itself. In order to gain access to the `grunt` console command, you must globally install the Grunt command-line interface:
```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Once `grunt-cli` has been installed, you can run the build and test commands with `grunt` and `grunt test`, respectively, without having to invoke the scripts via NPM.
